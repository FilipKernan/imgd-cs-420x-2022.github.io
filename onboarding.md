# Assignment 1 - Onboarding

This assignment counts towards the quizzes / in-class assignments portion of your grade.

1. First, check Canvas for an invite to the class Discord server. *All course announcements will be via Discord*. You must sign up ASAP for this server and check it regularly; it will also be a great place to ask questions and receive help. All questions regarding class content should be publicly asked in Discord whenever possible so that your classmates can a) potentially answer your question b) learn from any provided answers. Make sure to follow the onboarding instruction in the Discord server and change your nickname to your preferred first + last name and preferred pronouns.

2. Create a public website for all work completed in the course. The homepage for this website can be extremely minimal (potentially just a list of links); however, each assignment will generally require you to provide both text and video documentation of your work. Anybody should be able to visit your course website and quickly find this information. Once you have a URL for this website, please make a pull request on the main course website repo adding your link to the websites.md file.

3. Read / experiment with [the Book of Shaders](http://thebookofshaders.com) up through the lesson on [Shapes](https://thebookofshaders.com/07/), with the exception of the chapter "Running Your Shader" (feel free to read this if you like, but we won't be discussing the material in this chapter until next week, and even then only part of it). This will ensure that you have the necessary background for class on 1/17. 

4. All of the above are due by the start of class on 1/17. There may be a brief quiz about the assigned reading. If you need help setting up your website or making a pull request please reach out to the TA or SA as soon as possible!
